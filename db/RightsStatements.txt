In Copyright - EU Orphan Work
This Rights Statement is intended for use with Items for which the underlying Work has been identified as an Orphan Work in accordance with Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on certain permitted uses of Orphan Works. It can only be applied to Items derived from Works that are covered by the Directive: Works published in the form of books, journals, newspapers, magazines or other writings as well as cinematographic or audiovisual works and phonograms (note: this excludes photography and visual arts). It can only be applied by organizations that are beneficiaries of the Directive: publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, archives, film or audio heritage institutions and public-service broadcasting organizations, established in one of the EU member states. The beneficiary is also expected to have registered the work in the EU Orphan Works Database maintained by EUIPO.
